## Purpose:

The Tableau project aims to develop an interactive dashboard designed to visually represent and analyze Key Performance Indices (KPIs) related to the number of trips taken by Toronto Bike Share's member users vs. casual users. The focus is on providing insightful data visualizations that facilitate a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of the trips.

## Key Features:

### Time Block Analysis:

Creation of charts and graphs showcasing the count of trips for distinct time blocks, including morning, afternoon, evening, and night.

### Monthly Overview (2023):

Visual representation of trip counts across the months of the year 2023, offering a dynamic view of seasonal patterns and trends.

### Day-of-the-Week Breakdown:

Interactive charts and graphs illustrating trip counts on a day-by-day basis throughout the week. This provides a granular analysis of the distribution of trips over different days.

### Diverse Visualization Techniques:

Implementation of various visualization techniques such as bubble charts, tree maps, and tables to present the data in multiple dimensions, enabling users to gain deeper insights.

### User Interaction:

Incorporation of interactive elements within the dashboard to allow users to explore and filter data based on specific criteria. This feature enhances the user experience by enabling personalized and detailed analyses.

## Findings and Recommendation:

Analysis of trip data reveals a notable trend during the months of July, August, and September, where the total number of trips is lower compared to other months. Interestingly, a higher proportion of these trips are taken by annual members on Thursdays and Saturdays.


To capitalize on this observed pattern, the City of Toronto can strategically offer additional perks and incentives specifically targeted at annual members during July, August, and September, with a focus on Thursdays and Saturdays. By encouraging more trips on these days during the specified months, the city has the potential to attract and retain additional annual subscribers. This targeted approach aims to boost profits by increasing the utilization of the bike-sharing service among annual members during traditionally slower months, ultimately contributing to the growth and sustainability of the program.
